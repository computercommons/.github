# What is this repo?

GitHub allows some [customization of an organization's profile](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile).

One such customization is a long-form description, provided in a public repo named `.github`. It will display the file at `profile/README.md`.

That's this repo! It contains Computer Commons' profile README.
